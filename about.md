Hi! I'm Bra≈ào Rabatin - an astrophysicist and a part-time car enthusiast. Let me share some of the things I've worked on!

I spend my time wrestling with supersonic turbulence and creating BeamNG car mods. I occasionally manage to convince computers to do what I want (after a passive-aggressive glaring standoff).

When I'm not buried in statistics of turbulence or jbeaming the $h1t out of my recent BeamNG fad, you'll probably find me cycling around Tallahassee, playing ultimate frisbee or singing karaoke.

Stick around for a weird mix of physics and cars.
