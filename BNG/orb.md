        In the golden twilight of the postwar boom, Burnside set out to prove one thing: <strong>there was no such thing as “too much.”</strong> The Orbitron wasn’t just a car - it was a statement. Preferably parked in front of your Mid-Century Modern bungalow with the full chrome package, four-tone paint, and a display plaque reminding your neighbors that they lost the bidding war. It was the kind of car that made martinis taste colder, cigarettes look cooler, and divorce proceedings just a little more complicated.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the spoils of war funding consumer dreams, Burnside engineers were handed a blank check, a crate of declassified submarine blueprints, and a bucket of enriched uranium “for testing purposes.” What they built was the most audacious rolling appliance of atomic America - a 6.5-ton glass-domed parade float for your family, your ego, and your anxieties about communism. Born from military contracts and Madison Avenue fantasies, the Orbitron wasn't engineered - it was unleashed. It didn’t drive so much as <strong>announce itself</strong>, one slow, glowing mile at a time.
      </p>
      <h2>Two models. One apocalypse</h2>
      <h4><strong>Standard</strong></h4>
      <p>
        Fueled by a 10.4-liter water-cooled V20 originally designed for offshore oil rigs and coastal artillery turrets, the base model delivers 2,200 peak horsepower and 4,150 Nm of torque, ensuring the Orbitron moves, albeit with the urgency of a collapsing empire. Coupled with Dynatomic HyperMesh transmission, first tested at the Nevada Test Site alongside atmospheric bomb tests. Early units were known to cause pacemakers to skip a beat. Shifts are assisted by a trio of vacuum chambers and a repurposed radar tube. At idle, it ticks faintly - like a Geiger counter trying to tell you something important... A massive 200L fuel tank gives you a 250 mile range if you're lucky (as long as you do not turn on the AC).
      </p>
      <h4><strong>Premium</strong></h4>
      <p>
        The prestige trim swaps gasoline for glowing ambition. Powered by a compact nuclear turbine, it outputs a serene 1,700 hp with a low-end torque curve measured in megajoules. It makes very little noise, but does emit a low hum and a faint greenish glow at night. <strong>Do not store pets in the trunk</strong>. Its QuadraGlide CVDrive transmission was originally designed for nuclear submarine ballast control systems, now available with leather trim. In throttle we hope. We take brake on faith. <strong>Because nothing says power like moderate radiation exposure</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Orbitron wasn’t built for speed. It was built for spectacle. For the kind of people who believed the future had fins, that every driveway should glow faintly at night, and that safety was someone else’s problem. After all, why roll coal… when you can leave a legacy in isotopes?
