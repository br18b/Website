        Ever seen a car made by an airplane company? Well, this is it. The Saab 92A was Saab’s very first production car, and it shows - in the best possible way. Born in post-war Sweden and shaped by the same engineers who built fighter planes, it boasted a drag coefficient of just 0.3, making it one of the most aerodynamic cars of its time.
      </p>
      <p>
        But don't let the slippery shape fool you - this thing wasn’t breaking any speed records. Under the hood was a tiny 2-stroke, 760cc engine that sounded more like a chainsaw - or maybe an especially angry lawnmower - than a car. It buzzed and shrieked like a swarm of bees barreling toward you at full throttle. Which is kind of hilarious, considering its top speed was about 60 mph.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get there, you had to keep the revs screaming in that glorious 2-stroke comfort zone: somewhere between “this is fine” and “this engine might just lift off.” Fitting, really - for something designed by people who used to build airplanes.
